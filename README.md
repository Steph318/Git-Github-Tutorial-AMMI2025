# Git Bootcamp – Hands-on Labs

Welcome to this Git & GitHub mini bootcamp!  
This repository contains two practical labs (Lab 01 & Lab 02) designed to teach you how to use Git and GitHub progressively and interactively—both individually and in collaboration.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Learn to use Git from the command line
- Understand version control basics: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, etc.
- Collaborate with others and handle Git merge conflicts
- Work with advanced Git features: `rebase`, `revert`, `stash`
- Automate tasks with **GitHub Actions**
